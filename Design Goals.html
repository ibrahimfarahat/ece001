        <p style="font-size:40px;">The exact form of a computer system depends on the constraints and goals. Computer architectures usually trade off standards, power versus performance, cost, memory capacity, latency (latency is the amount of time that it takes for information from one node to travel to the source) and throughput. Sometimes other considerations, such as features, size, weight, reliability, and expandability are also factors.
            The most common scheme does an in-depth power analysis and figures out how to keep power consumption low while maintaining adequate performance.
